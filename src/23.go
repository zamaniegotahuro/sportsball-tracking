    Update ball state based on the current state.
    
    Parameters:
    - current_state: A dictionary representing the current game state.
                     It should contain keys 'ball_x', 'ball_y', 'ball_speed', and 'is_spare'.
    
    Returns:
    - updated_state: The updated state of the ball with new values.
                      If 'is_spare' is true, it represents a spare ball that can be used for another game;
                    otherwise, it's an empty dictionary if the ball has already been used or is out of its lane.
